                <li>A brief project information: motivations, design rationale for visual encoding decisions and
                    interaction techniques, takeaways, etc.</li>
                <li>A brief info about the design and development process: alternatives tried (e.g., sketches),
                    struggles, lessoned learned. Also mention how the workload was distributed among team members.</li>

                        Everyone is familiar with the historic sinking of the Titanic, the luxury cruiseliner that never completed its 
                        maiden voyage after colliding with an iceberg the morning of April 15, 1912. The goal of this project was 
                        to determine what types of individuals, based on their demographic information, were more likely to have survived 
                        the tragedy. Our visualization seeks to express not only the scale of the disaster, captured through 
                        aggregate data such as sex, class, and age, but also the toll of the disaster at the idividual level, manifested 
                        in the circles that represent specific passengers. 
                        <br><br>
                        Some of the visual econding decisions were easy, such as opting to use the color channel of red to denote those 
                        who lost their life.
